#tokens = "Previous research has suggested an important role for the emotion of hatred in intergroup aggression. Recent theoretical and empirical work has strongly suggested that the combination of anger, contempt, and disgust (ANCODI) comprise the basic elements of hatred, and are the key emotions associated with intergroup aggression. No study, however, has provided evidence that these emotions cause hostile cognitions about specific groups. We report two studies that provide initial evidence. In both, participants were members of ideologically motivated groups and were primed with ANCODI. In Study 1 participants primed with ANCODI produced more aggressive cognitions relative to their opponent outgroup than a neutral outgroup; this effect did not occur for participants primed with fear?sadness. In Study 2 participants primed with ANCODI engaged in more competitive decision making against their opponent outgroups than a neutral outgroup; this effect did not occur for participants primed with disgust only. These findings contribute to the literature on the role of emotion in intergroup aggression and hostility, and provide a more nuanced view of the role of emotions in intergroup relations, possibly identifying the basic emotional elements of hatred. Aggr. Behav. 43:93107, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.  Most work in the area of emotion and aggression has focused on interpersonal aggression (Anderson & Bushman,  ). But recent research has also given attention to the role of emotion in intergroup aggression and conflict (Cottrell & Neuberg,  ; Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu,  ; Mackie, Devos, & Smith,  ). The most recent studies have pointed to an important role for anger and especially hatred (Halperin,  ; Halperin, Canetti?Nisim, & Hirsch?Hoefler,  ; Halperin & Pliskin,  ; Kahn, Liberman, Halperin, & Ross,  ). Hatred, in fact, may be a central concept in understanding intergroup conflict and aggression: defining and identifying its elemental components would thus be worthwhile.  One theoretical framework has suggested that the more basic emotions of anger, contempt, and disgust comprise the three components of hatred, which in turn may be a contributing cause of many acts of aggression and violence (Sternberg,  ). According to this framework, anger provides the passion that exists in many types of hatred; contempt allows the devaluation and diminution of the targeted group, providing for a cognitive component to hatred that allows decisions and commitments concerning the moral unworthiness of others; and disgust allows a distancing of oneself from a target individual or group and a negation of intimacy. The most dangerous type of hatred supposedly occurs when all the three emotion components co?exist.  This theoretical framework is supported by data demonstrating although anger, contempt, and disgust are often related to each other, they are at the same time distinct, with unique appraisals that elicit them and with different social functions. In terms of appraisal (Ellsworth & Scherer,  ; Lazarus,  ), anger is triggered by goal obstruction, injustice, or norm violations; contempt is about status and moral or ethical superiority, and disgust is the emotion of contaminant elimination. These three emotions are elicited by violations of different moral codes: (1) anger is triggered by violations of individual rights and autonomy and appraisals of self?relevance; (2) contempt by violations of communal codes and hierarchy and appraisals of other's incompetence or lack of intelligence; and (3) disgust by violations of codes for purity and sanctity and appraisals of other's moral untrustworthiness (Hutcherson & Gross,  ; Rozin, Lowery, Imada, & Haidt,  ).  In terms of functions, anger facilitates the removal of obstacles, contempt makes a statement about inherent moral superiority, and disgust helps to eliminate or repulse contaminated objects (Rozin, Lowery et al.,  ). Anger has been associated with more short?term attack responses but also long?term reconciliation, in which individuals seek a less negative outcome by coercing change in another person's behavior (Fischer & Roseman,  ). Contempt is longer lasting, characterized by rejection, derogation, and social exclusion of others in both short and long term, implying more negative and permanent changes in beliefs about another person. Contempt is the feeling when one judges another person to be an inferior human being (Fischer,  ). Anger has been related to normative social actions, such as participating in demonstrations, signing petitions, or participating in acts of civil disobedience, whereas contempt is related to non?normative social actions, such as sabotage, violence, or terrorism (Tausch et al.,  ). Contempt has also been implicated in theories of prejudice (Brewer,  ), and disgust has been central to theories and empirical work on dehumanization (Buckels & Trapnell,  ; Cortes, Demoulin, Rodriguez, Rodriguez, & Leyens,  ; Demoulin et al.,  ) and prejudice (Dasgupta, DeSteno, Williams, & Hunsinger,  ; Levin, Pratto, Matthews, Sidanius, & Kteily,  ).  Recent studies have demonstrated a link between intergroup aggression and the combination of anger, contempt, and disgust (Matsumoto, Hwang, & Frank,  ,  ,  ). These studies examined the verbal and nonverbal behavior produced by leaders of ideologically motivated groups that subsequently either committed an act of aggression or engaged in an act of non?violent resistance against an opponent outgroup. Speeches of leaders as they talked about their opponent outgroups were obtained at three points in time leading up to the identified acts. Verbal and nonverbal behavior associated with those three emotions (and others) were assessed. Leaders of groups that eventually committed acts of aggression expressed metaphorical appraisals and nonverbal behavior related to anger, contempt, and disgust toward their opponent outgroups; other emotions did not differentiate groups that committed acts of aggression from those that did not.  These latest findings have led to the anger, contempt, and disgust (ANCODI) hypothesis of intergroup aggression, namely that this combination is a deadly mix that fuels intergroup hostility through condescension, dehumanization, and elimination, and that may serve as the basis of intergroup hatred (Matsumoto et al.,  ,  ,  ; Matsumoto, Frank, & Hwang,  ). According to the ANCODI hypothesis, not only anger but also contempt and disgust are important emotions to consider for intergroup aggression because they represent a shift from making a temporary assessment about an act committed by a group (anger) toward a permanent assessment of the nature of the opponent group (contempt) and its future status (disgust). Contempt provides moral justification for aggression by claiming the righteousness of one's existence and actions; disgust provides the impetus for elimination through perceptions of contamination. These emotions are ameliorated through elimination of the disgusting items, and in combination with anger fuel intergroup aggression and violence, are likely to form the basis of intergroup hatred.  The ANCODI hypothesis allows a more precise specification of the emotional factors that contribute to intergroup aggression and allows for a possible redefining of hatred. Thus, for intergroup aggression, it may be better to focus on the constellation of these three emotions to predict behavior rather than on single emotions. In Matsumoto et al.'s (  ,  ,  ) studies, words, language?based appraisals, and nonverbal behavior associated with anger by themselves did not differentiate groups that committed acts of aggression from those that did not; contempt and disgust were linked to the expressions of anger when it came to actual, real world violence. Anger, contempt, and disgust were also intercorrelated when expressed prior to acts of aggression; they were not correlated, however, prior to acts of resistance. Anger, in the absence of hatred (contempt and disgust, in the ANCODI paradigm), can be constructive (Halperin, Russell, Dweck, & Gross,  ).  One major limitation concerning previous findings that led to the ANCODI combination hypothesis (Matsumoto et al.,  ,  ,  ) was that they were correlational. Thus it was not clear that the ANCODI combination actually  caused  individuals to produce hostile cognitions or language. The purpose of the studies reported here was to examine whether or not the ANCODI mix causally produces hostile cognitions and language. If so, it would provide further evidence that the ANCODI combination contributes to intergroup hostility.  In Study 1, participants were randomly assigned to a condition in which either the ANCODI combination or a combination of fear and sadness (FESA) was primed. The FESA combination was included as a comparison because fear has been implicated in models of intergroup aggression (e.g., Halperin & Gross,  ), and sadness has been linked to mood effects on judgments (Forgas & Bower,  ). Also, fear and sadness represented different negative emotions, and it was important to distinguish whether the effects produced using the ANCODI elicitation could have been produced with any negative emotions. If the same effects were observed with the FESA combination, it would provide evidence for a more diffuse negative affect view of the role of emotion (Berkowitz,  ).  In Study 2 the ANCODI mix was compared with a disgust only condition. This allowed us to examine whether the effects that were observed by ANCODI could be elicited using only one of the emotions from the ANCODI combination. We selected disgust because we could use the same emotion elicitation technique to elicit ANCODI.  Because the ANCODI hypothesis was generated in studies examining political aggression between groups, in both studies we recruited participants who were members of ideologically based groups and who had an identified opponent outgroup with a cause that was opposed to the participant's ingroup's cause. The design of the studies therefore included conditions in which the target of the participants hostile cognitions and behavior was either the opponent outgroup, or a neutral outgroup in order to examine whether the effects of ANCODI were specific to the opponent outgroups or not.  In Study 1 the dependent variables were produced in a modified version of a well?known word completion task designed to assess aggressive cognitions (Anderson, Carnagey, & Eubanks,  ; Anderson et al.,  ). We predicted that participants primed with ANCODI would have more aggressive cognitions toward their opponent outgroup than toward a neutral group, but that this would not be the case for participants primed by FESA.  In Study 2 the dependent variables were two measures commonly employed in economic game theoryUltimatum and Proposer. These measures allowed the assessment of competitive, non?cooperative decision making. We predicted that participants primed with ANCODI would engage in more competitive, non?cooperative decision making toward the opponent outgroup than the neutral outgroup, whereas this would not be the case with participants primed only with disgust.  One major limitation concerning previous findings that led to the ANCODI combination hypothesis (Matsumoto et al.,  ,  ,  ) was that they were correlational. Thus it was not clear that the ANCODI combination actually  caused  individuals to produce hostile cognitions or language. The purpose of the studies reported here was to examine whether or not the ANCODI mix causally produces hostile cognitions and language. If so, it would provide further evidence that the ANCODI combination contributes to intergroup hostility.

Also, fear and sadness represented different negative emotions, and it was important to distinguish whether the effects produced using the ANCODI elicitation could have been produced with any negative emotions. If the same effects were observed with the FESA combination, it would provide evidence for a more diffuse negative affect view of the role of emotion (Berkowitz,  ).  In Study 2 the ANCODI mix was compared with a disgust only condition. This allowed us to examine whether the effects that were observed by ANCODI could be elicited using only one of the emotions from the ANCODI combination. We selected disgust because we could use the same emotion elicitation technique to elicit ANCODI.

The study was a 2 (Outgroup)?×?2 (Emotion Prime) between?subjects design. The Outgroup condition consisted of two levels:  Opponent Outgroup  vs.  Neutral Outgroup  ; the  Emotion Prime  condition consisted of ANCODI vs. FESA. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four cells prior to the experiment and assignments were conducted in blocks of four to ensure equal distributions across the cells as the experiment progressed. This also helped protect the random distribution to conditions of members of any given group as we were not certain if they would arrive in waves.  Individuals were recruited for the study if they were members of an ideologically motivated group, that is, a group with a political or ideological cause; there were other groups in existence that were opposed to the participant's group's cause; and there was evidence of past conflict between the groups, either reported in the news or self?reported by potential participants. Potential participants were recruited from university and college campus groups located in the San Francisco Bay Area and from the surrounding communities, who responded to an ad for an emotion and intergroup relations study. After excluding all participants who did not complete the procedures correctly, the final total sample in this study was  N  =?87 participants (33 males, 54 females;  M   age  =?23.46,  SD  =?7.13). Participants were provided $10 compensation.  Participants completed the NEO?Five Factor Inventory (Costa & McCrae,  ), the Aggression Questionnaire (Buss & Perry,  ), Social Dominance Orientation (Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, & Malle,  ), a Machiavellianism Scale (Christie,  ), and the Self?Monitoring Scale (Snyder,  ). These were not used in this study, so no further mention of them will be made. They also completed a standard demographic questionnaire that asked age, sex, marital status, household living situation, and religious background and practices.  Participants rated how much of each of 14 emotions they were currently experiencing using a 9?point scale labeled 0 (  none  ), through 4, (  moderate amount  ), to 8 (  extremely strong amount  ). The 14 emotions were guilt, fear, anger, embarrassment, worry, contempt, excitement, disgust, amusement, nervousness, surprise, interest, sadness, and pride. These ratings were collected at three points in time: Pre?, Mid?, and Post?Session.  Participants rated how much each of 25 emotions was felt about either their opponent or non?opponent outgroup as viewed by society and your organization. Ratings were completed using 5?point scales labeled 1 (  not at all  ) to 5 (  extremely  ) and included the following emotions: disappointed, fearful, sympathetic, envious, uneasy, proud, angry, disgusted, respectful, pitying, hateful, frustrated, jealous, admiring, resentful, inspired, contemptuous, compassionate, tense, ashamed, comfortable, fond, anxious, secure, and sadness. According to the procedures described by Fiske et al. (  ), an Admiration scale was produced using the mean of admiring, fond, inspired, proud, and respectful (??=?.89); a Contempt scale used the mean of angry, ashamed, contemptuous, disgusted, frustrated, hateful, resentful, uneasy (??=?.93); an Envy scale used the mean of envious and jealous (??=?.77); and a Pity scale used the mean of pity and sympathetic (??=?.77).  Prior to the session, participants named an opponent outgroup that was opposed to the participant's ingroup and where there was evidence of conflict between the groups in the past; they also confirmed these nominations before and during the experimental procedures. We classified the types of opponent outgroups into four categories: religious groups (e.g., American Martyrs, Mormon Church of Latter Day Saints, 33% of the total sample), political groups (e.g., SF Hillel, General Union of Palestine Students, 25.0%), government related groups (e.g., Israel, U.S. federal government, 21.5%), and social and sexual orientation groups (e.g., Queer Alliance, 20.1%). Participants were assigned to either the  Opponent Outgroup  or  Neutral Outgroup  conditions. The  Opponent Outgroup  was the outgroup specifically named by the participant as the group opposed to the participant's ingroup. The  Neutral Outgroup  was the National Book Club for all participants assigned to the  Neutral  Outgroup condition. This fictional entity was used because it was very unlikely that participants would harbor any positive or negative feelings toward them.  Emotions were elicited using selected images from the International Affective Pictures System (IAPS; Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert,  ). Two groups of IAPS images were used to elicit a combination of either ANCODI or FESA. A different group of images was used to elicit Positive emotions.  The ANCODI and FESA images were selected on the basis of a pilot study involving 20 images, 10 of which had the highest Anger ratings in Mikels et al. (  ) and 10 of which had the highest combination of fear and sadness in that study.  Contempt was not a rated category in the Mikels et al. (  ) study; thus we had to obtain those ratings. Participants (  N  =?34) were shown each of the images, one at a time and in a random order, and rated how much each image made them feel on seven emotion categories (anger, contempt disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise) using 7?point scales, labeled Not at All (0) to A Lot (6). T?tests comparing the ANCODI vs. FESA means were computed and the differences between the two sets of means were rank ordered according to Cohen  d  effect sizes. We also computed ANOVAs testing the interaction between the ratings and sex and followed significant interactions with simple effects analyses (males and females may have reacted differently to the stimuli). We selected for use in the main study those images with the highest Cohen  d  s and where the interactions with sex were either not significant or significant but indicated differences in degree but not direction. Six images were selected for ANCODI (9810, 6360, 9800, 9252, 6540, and 6212); these contained images of violence threatened or perpetrated against others, and White supremacy). Six images were selected for FESA (images 9600, 9620, 9611, 2205, 9050, and 3230); these contained images of ships sinking, airplane crashes, and dying hospital patients.  Positive images were selected on the basis of another pilot study involving 20 images, 10 of which had the highest Total Positive ratings and 10 of which had the lowest total sum of all emotions in Mikels et al. (  ). Participants (  N  =?35) were shown the images in the same manner as above and made the same ratings. For the Positive images we selected the six images with the highest Joy ratings (5910, 8190, 5480, 5626, 5621, and 8185).  From the list of words provided by Anderson et al. (  ,  ), we first sorted the words by the number of letters in the word and the number of letters missing in order to have a listing that was ordered in difficulty. We then identified the words that could produce either an aggressive or non?aggressive word when completed (e.g., h_t could result in hat or hit). The first 20 words identified in this manner were presented to participants in the order sorted.  Participants were also asked to use the word in a sentence related to the group condition assigned to ensure that the completed word was indeed a word associated with an aggressive cognition, and that the aggressive cognition was related to the assigned group.  Upon arrival participants were told that they would complete some questionnaires, view a slide show, and complete ratings about the images. Then they participated in a creativity task called the Directed Word Completion Task that required them to fill in the blanks of incomplete words and make up sentences with the words created, such that the words and sentences created were in relation to a group. Participants were told that they would be given 2?min to do as many of these as they could.  Participants then completed the Pre?session Emotion Checklist and the remaining individual difference measures. They subsequently saw two neutral images (not used elsewhere in the study) from the IAPS used for practice, and then the six images corresponding to their emotion elicitation condition. Each image was presented for 10?sec, after which participants were given 30?sec to state orally the most salient aspects of the image into a speaker on the computer. After presentation of all images, participants then completed the Mid?Session Emotion Checklist.  After emotion elicitation, participants were introduced to the word completion task:Now you will be asked to do a creativity task, which is a word completion task. You will be presented with words that contain missing letters. For example, you might be presented with something like this:   B__EB__EFor each word, your task is to first fill in the blank to complete the word and say the word out loud, and second, to use the word in a sentence about the GROUP listed here: <OUTGROUP NAME>.  You do not need to type for this task. Simply speak your answers out loud. When you are finished with the two tasks for each word, click Continue to move on to the next word.  You will be given a total of 2?min to complete this task for as many words as you can. Please click Continue when ready to proceed.The name of the outgroup appropriate to the condition was inserted above, that is, either the opponent outgroup named by the participant or the National Book Club. Participants responses were captured by a webcam attached to the computer monitor.  After finishing the word completion task participants saw the positive emotion images, completed a Post?Session Emotion Checklist, were debriefed, paid, and excused. All experimental procedures were administered using Medialab.  One point was assigned to each completed word that matched an aggressive word according to Anderson et al. (  ,  ). One point was also assigned to each completed sentence when two independent coders blind to the condition agreed that the word was used in an aggressive manner in a produced sentence. A Total Aggressive Cognitions score was computed by summing both the number of aggressive word completions and sentence productions.  The study was a 2 (Outgroup)?×?2 (Emotion Prime) between?subjects design. The Outgroup condition consisted of two levels:  Opponent Outgroup  vs.  Neutral Outgroup  ; the  Emotion Prime  condition consisted of ANCODI vs. FESA. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four cells prior to the experiment and assignments were conducted in blocks of four to ensure equal distributions across the cells as the experiment progressed. This also helped protect the random distribution to conditions of members of any given group as we were not certain if they would arrive in waves.  Individuals were recruited for the study if they were members of an ideologically motivated group, that is, a group with a political or ideological cause; there were other groups in existence that were opposed to the participant's group's cause; and there was evidence of past conflict between the groups, either reported in the news or self?reported by potential participants. Potential participants were recruited from university and college campus groups located in the San Francisco Bay Area and from the surrounding communities, who responded to an ad for an emotion and intergroup relations study. After excluding all participants who did not complete the procedures correctly, the final total sample in this study was  N  =?87 participants (33 males, 54 females;  M   age  =?23.46,  SD  =?7.13).

Each image was presented for 10?sec, after which participants were given 30?sec to state orally the most salient aspects of the image into a speaker on the computer. After presentation of all images, participants then completed the Mid?Session Emotion Checklist.  After emotion elicitation, participants were introduced to the word completion task:Now you will be asked to do a creativity task, which is a word completion task. You will be presented with words that contain missing letters. For example, you might be presented with something like this:   B__EB__EFor each word, your task is to first fill in the blank to complete the word and say the word out loud, and second, to use the word in a sentence about the GROUP listed here: <OUTGROUP NAME>.  You do not need to type for this task. Simply speak your answers out loud. When you are finished with the two tasks for each word, click Continue to move on to the next word.  You will be given a total of 2?min to complete this task for as many words as you can. Please click Continue when ready to proceed.The name of the outgroup appropriate to the condition was inserted above, that is, either the opponent outgroup named by the participant or the National Book Club. Participants responses were captured by a webcam attached to the computer monitor.  After finishing the word completion task participants saw the positive emotion images, completed a Post?Session Emotion Checklist, were debriefed, paid, and excused. All experimental procedures were administered using Medialab.  One point was assigned to each completed word that matched an aggressive word according to Anderson et al. (  ,  ). One point was also assigned to each completed sentence when two independent coders blind to the condition agreed that the word was used in an aggressive manner in a produced sentence. A Total Aggressive Cognitions score was computed by summing both the number of aggressive word completions and sentence productions.  Participants completed the NEO?Five Factor Inventory (Costa & McCrae,  ), the Aggression Questionnaire (Buss & Perry,  ), Social Dominance Orientation (Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, & Malle,  ), a Machiavellianism Scale (Christie,  ), and the Self?Monitoring Scale (Snyder,  ). These were not used in this study, so no further mention of them will be made. They also completed a standard demographic questionnaire that asked age, sex, marital status, household living situation, and religious background and practices.  Participants rated how much of each of 14 emotions they were currently experiencing using a 9?point scale labeled 0 (  none  ), through 4, (  moderate amount  ), to 8 (  extremely strong amount  ). The 14 emotions were guilt, fear, anger, embarrassment, worry, contempt, excitement, disgust, amusement, nervousness, surprise, interest, sadness, and pride. These ratings were collected at three points in time: Pre?, Mid?, and Post?Session.  Participants rated how much each of 25 emotions was felt about either their opponent or non?opponent outgroup as viewed by society and your organization. Ratings were completed using 5?point scales labeled 1 (  not at all  ) to 5 (  extremely  ) and included the following emotions: disappointed, fearful, sympathetic, envious, uneasy, proud, angry, disgusted, respectful, pitying, hateful, frustrated, jealous, admiring, resentful, inspired, contemptuous, compassionate, tense, ashamed, comfortable, fond, anxious, secure, and sadness. According to the procedures described by Fiske et al. (  ), an Admiration scale was produced using the mean of admiring, fond, inspired, proud, and respectful (??=?.89); a Contempt scale used the mean of angry, ashamed, contemptuous, disgusted, frustrated, hateful, resentful, uneasy (??=?.93); an Envy scale used the mean of envious and jealous (??=?.77); and a Pity scale used the mean of pity and sympathetic (??=?.77).  Prior to the session, participants named an opponent outgroup that was opposed to the participant's ingroup and where there was evidence of conflict between the groups in the past; they also confirmed these nominations before and during the experimental procedures. We classified the types of opponent outgroups into four categories: religious groups (e.g., American Martyrs, Mormon Church of Latter Day Saints, 33% of the total sample), political groups (e.g., SF Hillel, General Union of Palestine Students, 25.0%), government related groups (e.g., Israel, U.S. federal government, 21.5%), and social and sexual orientation groups (e.g., Queer Alliance, 20.1%). Participants were assigned to either the  Opponent Outgroup  or  Neutral Outgroup  conditions. The  Opponent Outgroup  was the outgroup specifically named by the participant as the group opposed to the participant's ingroup. The  Neutral Outgroup  was the National Book Club for all participants assigned to the  Neutral  Outgroup condition. This fictional entity was used because it was very unlikely that participants would harbor any positive or negative feelings toward them.  Emotions were elicited using selected images from the International Affective Pictures System (IAPS; Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert,  ). Two groups of IAPS images were used to elicit a combination of either ANCODI or FESA. A different group of images was used to elicit Positive emotions.  The ANCODI and FESA images were selected on the basis of a pilot study involving 20 images, 10 of which had the highest Anger ratings in Mikels et al. (  ) and 10 of which had the highest combination of fear and sadness in that study.  Contempt was not a rated category in the Mikels et al. (  ) study; thus we had to obtain those ratings. Participants (  N  =?34) were shown each of the images, one at a time and in a random order, and rated how much each image made them feel on seven emotion categories (anger, contempt disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise) using 7?point scales, labeled Not at All (0) to A Lot (6). T?tests comparing the ANCODI vs. FESA means were computed and the differences between the two sets of means were rank ordered according to Cohen's  d  effect sizes. We also computed ANOVAs testing the interaction between the ratings and sex and followed significant interactions with simple effects analyses (males and females may have reacted differently to the stimuli). We selected for use in the main study those images with the highest Cohen's  d  s and where the interactions with sex were either not significant or significant but indicated differences in degree but not direction. Six images were selected for ANCODI (9810, 6360, 9800, 9252, 6540, and 6212); these contained images of violence threatened or perpetrated against others, and White supremacy). Six images were selected for FESA (images 9600, 9620, 9611, 2205, 9050, and 3230); these contained images of ships sinking, airplane crashes, and dying hospital patients.  Positive images were selected on the basis of another pilot study involving 20 images, 10 of which had the highest Total Positive ratings and 10 of which had the lowest total sum of all emotions in Mikels et al. (  ). Participants (  N  =?35) were shown the images in the same manner as above and made the same ratings. For the Positive images we selected the six images with the highest Joy ratings (5910, 8190, 5480, 5626, 5621, and 8185).  From the list of words provided by Anderson et al. (  ,  ), we first sorted the words by the number of letters in the word and the number of letters missing in order to have a listing that was ordered in difficulty. We then identified the words that could produce either an aggressive or non?aggressive word when completed (e.g., h_t could result in hat or hit). The first 20 words identified in this manner were presented to participants in the order sorted.  Participants were also asked to use the word in a sentence related to the group condition assigned to ensure that the completed word was indeed a word associated with an aggressive cognition, and that the aggressive cognition was related to the assigned group.  Upon arrival participants were told that they would complete some questionnaires, view a slide show, and complete ratings about the images. Then they participated in a creativity task called the Directed Word Completion Task that required them to fill in the blanks of incomplete words and make up sentences with the words created, such that the words and sentences created were in relation to a group. Participants were told that they would be given 2?min to do as many of these as they could.  Participants then completed the Pre?session Emotion Checklist and the remaining individual difference measures. They subsequently saw two neutral images (not used elsewhere in the study) from the IAPS used for practice, and then the six images corresponding to their emotion elicitation condition. Each image was presented for 10?sec, after which participants were given 30?sec to state orally the most salient aspects of the image into a speaker on the computer. After presentation of all images, participants then completed the Mid?Session Emotion Checklist.  After emotion elicitation, participants were introduced to the word completion task:Now you will be asked to do a creativity task, which is a word completion task.

One point was also assigned to each completed sentence when two independent coders blind to the condition agreed that the word was used in an aggressive manner in a produced sentence. A Total Aggressive Cognitions score was computed by summing both the number of aggressive word completions and sentence productions.  We examined changes in ANCODI and FESA means from pre? to mid?session (immediately after the emotion elicitation task), separately for the two emotion elicitation conditions. In the ANCODI condition, ANCODI means significantly increased from pre? to mid?session,  t  (43)?=?6.78,  P  <?.001,  d  =?1.16; FESA means also increased,  t  (43)?=?2.88,  P  =.006,  d  =?.56. In the FESA condition FESA means increased significantly,  t  (40)?=?4.33,  P  <?.001,  d  =?.79, but there was no change in ANCODI means,  t  (40)?=.25,  ns  ,  d  =?.06.  We also examined changes in specific emotions by computing the simple effects of emotion for the five target emotions (anger, contempt, disgust, fear, and sadness) and the two emotion prime conditions (see Table  ). As intended, anger, contempt, and disgust each increased in the ANCODI condition, and fear and sadness increased in the FESA condition. But sadness also increased in the ANCODI condition.  Intercorrelations were computed among anger, contempt, and disgust ratings, separately at pre?, mid?, and post?session. Across the three sessions the mean correlations were .36, .69, and .37 for angercontempt, angerdisgust, and contemptdisgust, respectively.  We examined differences in SCM ratings between the  Opponent  and  Neutral  outgroups. Our main focus was on SCM Admiration and Contempt. The  Neutral  outgroup was rated significantly higher on Admiration,  F  (1, 83)?=?12.40,  P  <?.001,  ?  p    2  =?.13 whereas the  Opponent  outgroups were rated higher on Contempt,  F  (1, 83)?=?48.84,  P  <?.001,  ?  p    2  =?.37; Thus it appeared that the outgroup manipulations worked as intended. The Opponent outgroups were also rated higher on Envy and Pity,  F  (1, 83)?=?13.07,  P  <?.001,  ?  p    2  =?.14; and  F  (1, 83)?=?9.05,  P  <?.01,  ?  p    2  =?.10, respectively.  We computed a 2 (Emotion Prime) by 2 (Outgroup Type) ANOVA on the aggressive word scores (see Table  for descriptive statistics). The main effects of both  Emotion Prime  and  Outgroup Type  were significant,  F  (1, 83)?=?22.02,  P  <?.001,  ?  p    2  =?.13; and  F  (1, 83)?=?6.65,  P  =?.012,  ?  p    2  =.07, respectively. Importantly, the interaction was also significant,  F  (1, 83)?=?13.34,  P  <?.001,  ?  p    2  =?.14, indicating that, as predicted, participants primed with ANCODI produced more aggressive word completions in the opponent outgroup condition than the neutral outgroup compared to participants primed with FESA.  A 2 (Emotion Prime) by 2 (Outgroup Type) ANOVA on the aggressive sentences produced a significant main effect for  Outgroup Type  ,  F  (1, 83)?=?22.46,  P  <?.001,  ?  p    2  =?.21; but did not produce a significant main effect for  Emotion Prime  ,  F  (1, 83)?=?2.65,  P  =?.107,  ?  p    2  =?.03. The interaction was also significant,  F  (1, 83)?=?9.18,  P  =?.003,  ?  p    2  =?.10, indicating that, as predicted, participants primed with ANCODI produced more aggressive sentences in the opponent outgroup condition than the neutral outgroup compared to participants primed with FESA.  A 2 (Emotion Prime) by 2 (Outgroup Type) ANOVA on Total Aggressive Cognitions produced significant main effects of both  Emotion Prime  and  Outgroup Type  ,  F  (1, 83)?=?22.53,  P  <?.001,  ?  p    2  =?.24; and  F  (1, 83)?=?27.89,  P  <?.001,  ?  p    2  =?.25, respectively. The interaction was also significant,  F  (1, 83)?=?25.83,  P  <?.001,  ?  p    2  =?.24, indicating that, as predicted, participants primed with ANCODI produced more Total Aggressive Cognitions in the opponent outgroup condition than the neutral outgroup compared to participants primed with FESA (see Fig.  ).  We computed correlations between the target emotions (anger, contempt, disgust, fear, and sadness) assessed right after the IAPS manipulation and each of the dependent variables, once for the entire sample and then separately for  Neutral  and  Opponent Outgroups  (see Table  for findings for the entire sample). Anger and disgust were individually correlated with all three dependent variables; contempt was correlated with Aggressive Sentences. Neither fear nor sadness was correlated with any of the dependents.  This pattern of correlations demonstrated that anger, contempt and disgust individually contributed to the dependent variables, but fear and sadness did not, despite the increase in sadness in the ANCODI condition. We recomputed the correlations between the dependent variables and anger, partialling mid?session contempt and disgust. No effects were statistically significant. Reversing these analyses, however, indicated that disgust was significantly correlated with aggressive words and Total Aggressive Cognitions even after partialling anger and contempt,  r  p   (81)?=?.23,  P  =?.018; and  r  p   (81)?=?.25,  P  =?.013, respectively. Contempt was marginally significantly correlated with aggressive words even after partialling anger and disgust,  r  p   (81)?=?.15,  P  =?.093. These results indicated that disgust, and to a lesser extent contempt, contributed uniquely to the dependent variables.  To deal with the multicollinearity among the target emotions and to assess their possible meditational effects, both singly and in combination, we computed the indirect effects of the target emotions and their interactions on the relationship between the emotion prime conditions and the dependent variables using a multiple mediator analysis with bootstrapping (Preacher & Hayes,  ; 1,000 bootstrap samples were computed). All four possible interaction terms among the target emotions were included along with their main effects. Total indirect effects were computed and tested according to the procedures described by Preacher and Hayes (  ).  The results are reported in Table  . The total indirect effects were significant for all three dependents,  z  (87)?=?1.98,  P  =?.024;  z  (87)?=?2.98,  P  =?.001; and  z  (87)?=?2.53,  P  =?.006, for aggressive words, aggressive sentences, and total aggression, respectively. Moreover, the mean, bootstrapped coefficients were positive for all mediators. Analysis of bias corrected 95% CIs that did not include zero indicated that anger and contempt uniquely mediated aggressive words; anger, contempt, and the anger?×?disgust interaction uniquely mediated aggressive sentences; and contempt uniquely mediated Total Aggression.  We examined changes in ANCODI and FESA means from pre? to mid?session (immediately after the emotion elicitation task), separately for the two emotion elicitation conditions. In the ANCODI condition, ANCODI means significantly increased from pre? to mid?session,  t  (43)?=?6.78,  P  <?.001,  d  =?1.16; FESA means also increased,  t  (43)?=?2.88,  P  =.006,  d  =?.56. In the FESA condition FESA means increased significantly,  t  (40)?=?4.33,  P  <?.001,  d  =?.79, but there was no change in ANCODI means,  t  (40)?=.25,  ns  ,  d  =?.06.

We computed a 2 (Emotion Prime) by 2 (Outgroup Type) ANOVA on the aggressive word scores (see Table  for descriptive statistics). The main effects of both  Emotion Prime  and  Outgroup Type  were significant,  F  (1, 83)?=?22.02,  P  <?.001,  ?  p    2  =?.13; and  F  (1, 83)?=?6.65,  P  =?.012,  ?  p    2  =.07, respectively.

A 2 (Emotion Prime) by 2 (Outgroup Type) ANOVA on Total Aggressive Cognitions produced significant main effects of both  Emotion Prime  and  Outgroup Type  ,  F  (1, 83)?=?22.53,  P  <?.001,  ?  p    2  =?.24; and  F  (1, 83)?=?27.89,  P  <?.001,  ?  p    2  =?.25, respectively. The interaction was also significant,  F  (1, 83)?=?25.83,  P  <?.001,  ?  p    2  =?.24, indicating that, as predicted, participants primed with ANCODI produced more Total Aggressive Cognitions in the opponent outgroup condition than the neutral outgroup compared to participants primed with FESA (see Fig.  ).
